# Quellcode Dokumentation

I originally wanted to print the docs/api files but this resulted in some minor issues where I cannot access all of my doc files on paper (just links).

To access the docs over a http server I instead ran:
    
    npm i -g http-server
    cd .\doc\api\
    http-server -p 8000

Then I was able to open the server and access my full docs.
For now the documentation is accessible like this, a printable version is in work.

The doc/api folder with all code docs will be published on github too.
